## ü™ù Hooks

Hooks are shell scripts that run automatically at specific lifecycle events in Cursor, enabling deterministic automation that doesn't rely on AI interpretation.

### What are Cursor Hooks?

Cursor Hooks (beta feature in v1.7+) provide lifecycle event handlers that execute at specific points during Cursor's operation:

- `beforeSubmitPrompt` - When user submits a prompt
- `beforeShellExecution` - Before executing shell commands
- `beforeMCPExecution` - Before MCP tool calls
- `beforeReadFile` - Before sending file contents to AI
- `afterFileEdit` - After AI modifies a file
- `stop` - When a task completes

**Why Hooks?** Unlike rules or MCP servers, hooks are:
- ‚úÖ **Deterministic** - Always execute the same way
- ‚úÖ **Fast** - No LLM overhead
- ‚úÖ **Controllable** - Can block/allow operations
- ‚úÖ **Background-capable** - Run async processes

## üìê Rules

Rules define how Cursor's AI should behave, communicate, and generate code for specific contexts and domains.

### What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are guidelines that shape AI behavior in your projects. They can be:

- **Global Rules** - Applied across all projects (Cursor Settings ‚Üí Rules for AI)
- **Project Rules** - Specific to a project (`.cursor/*.mdc` files with dynamic activation)
- **Legacy Rules** - Older `.cursorrules` files (still supported but deprecated)

Rules use the `.mdc` format with metadata:
- `description` - When this rule should apply
- `alwaysApply` - Whether to apply automatically (true/false)

## üîå MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers enable Cursor to connect with external tools and services through a standardized interface.

### What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that enables AI applications to securely connect with external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that lets Cursor communicate with any service through a consistent API.

**Key Benefits:**
- üîó **Standardized Integration** - One protocol for all services
- üîí **Secure Connections** - Built-in security best practices
- üöÄ **Easy Setup** - Simple JSON configuration
- üîß **Extensible** - Build custom MCP servers for any service

**Result**: Every time Cursor edits a file, it's automatically formatted with Prettier (JS/TS) or Black (Python).

### Example 5: Team Notifications

**Scenario**: Notify team when Cursor completes tasks

**Setup**:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "stop": [
      {"command": ".cursor/hooks/automation/slack-detailed-notifications.sh"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Environment**:
```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
```

**Result**: Team receives Slack notification with task details when AI completes work.
