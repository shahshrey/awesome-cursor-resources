# Enhanced AI Mode for Complex Tasks - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Analyze Codebase Structure

1. Run `git ls-files` to understand file organization and project layout

2. Execute directory tree commands (if available) for visual structure

3. Identify key directories and their purposes

4. Note the technology stack and frameworks in use

## 2. Read Project Documentation

1. Read README.md for project overview and setup instructions

2. Check for any additional documentation in docs/ or ai_docs/

3. Review any CONTRIBUTING.md or development guides

4. Look for architecture or design documents

## 3. Understand Project Context

1. Identify the project's primary purpose and goals

2. Note any special setup requirements or dependencies

3. Check for environment configuration needs

4. Review any CI/CD configuration files

## 4. Provide Concise Overview

1. Summarize the project's purpose in 2-3 sentences

2. List the main technologies and frameworks

3. Highlight any important setup steps

4. Note key areas of the codebase

## 5. Use Cases

This command helps establish context quickly when:
- Starting work on a new project
- Returning to a project after time away
- Onboarding new team members
- Preparing for deep technical work

The goal is to "prime" the AI assistant with essential project knowledge for more effective assistance.
