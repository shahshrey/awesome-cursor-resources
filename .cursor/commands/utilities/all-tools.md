# Display All Available Development Tools - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Tool Discovery

1. Access the system prompt to identify all available tools

2. Extract tool information including:
   - Function signatures
   - Parameter types
   - Return types
   - Tool purposes

## 2. Format Tool Information

1. **List each tool** with its TypeScript function signature

2. **Include the purpose** of each tool as a suffix

3. **Use double line breaks** between tools for readability

4. **Format as bullet points** for clear organization

## 3. Present Formatted Output

1. Display tools in the following format:

```typescript
• functionName(parameters: Type): ReturnType - Purpose of the tool

• anotherFunction(params: ParamType): ResultType - What this tool does
```

2. Ensure output helps developers understand:
   - What tools are available in the current Cursor session
   - The exact function signatures for reference
   - The primary purpose of each tool

## 4. Use Cases

This command is useful for:
- Quick reference of available capabilities
- Understanding tool signatures
- Planning which tools to use for specific tasks
