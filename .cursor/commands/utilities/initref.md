# Initialize Reference Documentation - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Analyze Project Structure

1. Identify important files and directories in the project

2. Prioritize files based on their significance to project implementation

3. Determine which files need direct reading vs summarization

## 2. Gather File Summaries

1. Use provided summarize tool to get summaries of files

2. Avoid reading the content of many files directly to prevent hitting usage limits

3. Do read the content of critical/important files for accuracy

4. Collect and organize the returned summaries

## 3. Create Reference Documentation

1. Create reference files in /ref directory

2. Use markdown format for writing the documentation files

3. Organize documentation by:
   - Component or module
   - Feature area
   - Technical domain
   - Dependency relationships

4. Include implementation details, patterns, and key architectural decisions

## 4. Update Master Documentation

1. Update CLAUDE.md file with pointers to important documentation files

2. Create clear navigation structure for reference documentation

3. Ensure documentation is easily accessible and well-organized
