# Resume Current Task - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Assess Current State

1. Review any active todo items to understand what tasks remain.

2. Check the conversation history to identify the current context and what has been completed so far.

3. Identify any pending tasks, incomplete implementations, or unresolved issues.

4. Determine the next logical step based on the current state.

## 2. Update Task Status

1. Mark any completed todo items as done using the appropriate task management tools.

2. Identify which tasks are currently in progress versus pending.

3. Update the task list to reflect the current state accurately.

## 3. Continue Execution

1. Proceed with the next pending task in the sequence.

2. Execute the necessary tool calls and operations to advance the task.

3. Follow the same quality standards and approach as the original task initiation.

4. Maintain consistency with the original task objectives and requirements.

## 4. Verify Completion

1. After completing each subtask, verify the implementation meets the requirements.

2. Check for any errors, linter issues, or incomplete functionality.

3. Fix any issues discovered during verification.

## 5. Assess Overall Progress

1. Determine if all tasks are complete or if more work remains.

2. If all tasks are complete and verified, confirm completion to the USER.
