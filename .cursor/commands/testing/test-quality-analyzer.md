# Test Quality Analyzer - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Coverage Quality Assessment

1. Check coverage data: !`find . -name "coverage" -type d | head -1 && echo "Coverage data available" || echo "No coverage data"`
2. Analyze coverage depth beyond simple percentage metrics
3. Evaluate coverage quality in critical business logic
4. Assess edge case handling completeness
5. Identify coverage gaps and weaknesses
6. Measure coverage effectiveness per test

## 2. Test Effectiveness Evaluation

1. Analyze test files: !`find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | wc -l` test files
2. Measure defect detection capability of test suite
3. Analyze test reliability and consistency
4. Assess assertion quality and specificity
5. Evaluate test value and return on investment
6. Identify redundant or low-value tests

## 3. Maintainability Analysis

1. Evaluate test code quality and structure
2. Analyze test organization and naming conventions
3. Assess refactoring needs for test suite
4. Optimize test structure for readability
5. Identify code duplication in tests
6. Evaluate test setup and teardown patterns

## 4. Performance Assessment

1. Analyze current execution times and resource utilization
2. Analyze test execution performance metrics
3. Identify performance bottlenecks in tests
4. Optimize test speed without sacrificing quality
5. Reduce resource consumption where possible
6. Evaluate parallel execution opportunities

## 5. Anti-Pattern Detection

1. Identify common testing anti-patterns
2. Detect flaky tests with inconsistent results
3. Analyze test smells and code issues
4. Recommend corrections for identified problems
5. Detect brittle tests with excessive coupling
6. Identify over-mocking or under-mocking patterns

## 6. Quality Metrics Tracking

1. Implement comprehensive quality scoring system
2. Track improvement trends over time
3. Configure quality gates for continuous monitoring
4. Optimize quality processes based on metrics
5. Correlate quality metrics with defect rates
6. Generate quality scorecards and reports

## 7. Advanced Features Implementation

1. Implement AI-powered quality assessment
2. Configure predictive quality modeling
3. Setup automated improvement suggestions
4. Enable quality trend analysis with alerts
5. Implement benchmark comparison with industry standards

## 8. Quality Insights Generation

1. Perform test ROI analysis for investment decisions
2. Conduct quality correlation analysis
3. Assess maintenance cost and effort
4. Compare effectiveness against benchmarks
5. Identify high-impact improvement opportunities

## 9. Output Delivery

1. Deliver comprehensive quality analysis report
2. Provide detailed metrics with context
3. Include prioritized improvement recommendations
4. Document optimization strategies
5. Deliver quality tracking framework and dashboards
