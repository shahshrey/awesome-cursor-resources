<task name="Testing Plan Integration">

<task_objective>
Create comprehensive integration testing plan with inline test strategy and refactoring suggestions. This workflow analyzes code testability, designs integration test approaches, identifies refactoring opportunities, and plans test execution. The output is a comprehensive integration test plan with test case specifications, refactoring recommendations, implementation strategy, and quality metrics.

# Testing Plan Integration - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Code Testability Analysis

1. Detect project type: !`[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "Rust project" || [ -f package.json ] && echo "Node.js project" || echo "Multi-language project"`
2. Analyze target code structure and architecture
3. Identify testing challenges and obstacles
4. Assess coupling levels between components
5. Evaluate dependency injection patterns
6. Identify testability improvements needed

## 2. Test Strategy Design

1. Detect test framework: !`find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | head -3` existing tests
2. Design integration test approach and scope
3. Plan inline vs separate test file strategy
4. Identify test boundaries and isolation points
5. Optimize test isolation for reliability
6. Consider Rust-style inline testing where applicable

## 3. Refactoring Assessment

1. Identify testability improvement opportunities
2. Suggest dependency injection patterns
3. Recommend interface abstractions for decoupling
4. Optimize component boundaries for testing
5. Assess code changes needed for testability
6. Prioritize refactoring by impact and effort

## 4. Test Case Planning

1. Assess integration complexity of components
2. Design integration test scenarios
3. Identify critical integration paths
4. Plan data flow testing across components
5. Assess error handling coverage in integration
6. Document test case specifications

## 5. Mock Strategy Planning

1. Plan external dependency mocking approach
2. Design test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes)
3. Identify integration boundaries for mocking
4. Optimize test performance with selective mocking
5. Plan service virtualization where needed
6. Consider contract testing for API boundaries

## 6. Execution Planning

1. Design test execution order and dependencies
2. Plan test data management and setup
3. Optimize test environment setup procedures
4. Ensure proper test isolation between runs
5. Configure parallel execution where possible
6. Plan CI/CD integration for automated execution

## 7. Advanced Features Implementation

1. Implement Rust-style inline testing patterns
2. Configure property-based integration tests
3. Setup contract testing for service boundaries
4. Implement service virtualization for external dependencies
5. Integrate chaos engineering for resilience testing

## 8. Quality Assurance Planning

1. Ensure test maintainability in design
2. Optimize execution performance
3. Plan for comprehensive coverage
4. Design efficient feedback loops
5. Consider scalability of test approach

## 9. Output Delivery

1. Deliver comprehensive integration test plan
2. Provide detailed test case specifications
3. Include refactoring recommendations with priorities
4. Document implementation strategy and approach
5. Deliver quality metrics framework
