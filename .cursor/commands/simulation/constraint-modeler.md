<task name="Constraint Modeler">

<task_objective>
Model system constraints with validation, dependency mapping, and optimization strategies. Takes constraint domain as input (business, technical, regulatory, or resource constraints), processes it through comprehensive constraint frameworks including hard, soft, and dynamic constraints with dependency mapping and validation, and generates a complete constraint model with interaction matrices, validation reports, optimization recommendations, and scenario boundary definitions.

# Constraint Modeler - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Establish Current System Context

1. Define domain scope based on $ARGUMENTS (business, technical, operational, financial).

2. Identify existing constraints from @documentation or configuration files.

3. Document system boundaries including current limitations and dependencies.

4. Analyze change dynamics through historical constraint evolution patterns.

## 2. Define Constraint Domain Focus

1. Use $ARGUMENTS to focus analysis on business, technical, regulatory, or resource constraints.

2. Determine scope and depth of constraint modeling required.

3. Identify stakeholders affected by different constraint types.

## 3. Identify Hard Constraints

1. Document absolute limits that cannot be violated including legal constraints.

2. Identify physical constraints and technical limitations.

3. Map regulatory requirements and compliance mandates.

4. Establish non-negotiable boundaries for the system.

## 4. Model Soft Constraints

1. Identify preferences and trade-offs that can be managed.

2. Document budget constraints and quality parameters.

3. Model timing preferences and scheduling flexibility.

4. Establish priority rankings for soft constraint optimization.

## 5. Analyze Dynamic Constraints

1. Identify limitations that evolve over time including market constraints.

2. Model technology evolution and capability changes.

3. Document capacity constraints and growth patterns.

4. Establish monitoring systems for dynamic constraint tracking.

## 6. Map Constraint Dependencies

1. Identify relationships and interactions between different limitations.

2. Create dependency matrices showing constraint interconnections.

3. Analyze cascade effects where one constraint triggers others.

4. Document constraint hierarchies and precedence rules.

## 7. Implement Validation Framework

1. Verify constraint accuracy through data validation and expert review.

2. Test constraint relevance for current system state.

3. Validate constraint interactions and dependency mappings.

4. Establish ongoing validation processes for constraint accuracy.

## 8. Perform Advanced Analysis

1. Execute constraint sensitivity analysis to identify critical limitations.

2. Identify bottleneck constraints limiting system performance.

3. Define scenario boundaries based on constraint combinations.

4. Apply optimization algorithms to constraint relaxation opportunities.

## 9. Develop Optimization Strategies

1. Identify approaches to relax non-critical constraints.

2. Develop constraint substitution strategies for flexibility.

3. Create workaround solutions to circumvent limiting constraints.

4. Provide trade-off analysis for constraint optimization decisions.

## 10. Generate Strategic Applications

1. Link constraint models to decision scenarios and planning.

2. Integrate constraints into resource allocation frameworks.

3. Connect constraint analysis to strategic planning processes.

4. Deliver complete constraint model with interaction matrices, validation reports, optimization recommendations, and scenario boundary definitions.
