<task name="Market Response Modeler">

<task_objective>
Model comprehensive market and customer responses with segment analysis, behavioral prediction, and optimization. Takes market trigger as input (product launch, pricing change, marketing campaign, or competitive response), processes it through response frameworks including market segmentation, response behavior modeling, competitive response integration, simulation, prediction algorithms, and optimization, and generates complete market response prediction with segment analysis, optimization recommendations, competitive scenarios, and implementation guidelines for maximum market impact.
