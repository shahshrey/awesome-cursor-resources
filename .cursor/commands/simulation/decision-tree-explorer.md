<task name="Decision Tree Explorer">

<task_objective>
Explore complex decision branches with probability analysis, expected value calculation, and optimization. Takes decision context as input (strategic, investment, operational, or crisis response), processes it through decision frameworks including option generation, probability assessment, expected value analysis, sensitivity analysis, risk assessment, and optimization, and generates a complete decision tree with probability-weighted outcomes, expected value calculations, risk assessments, and strategic recommendations with implementation guidance.

# Decision Tree Explorer - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Establish Current Decision Context

1. Define decision scope based on $ARGUMENTS (strategic, investment, operational, crisis response).

2. Identify available options and current alternatives under consideration.

3. Define success criteria and key metrics for decision evaluation.

4. Document resource constraints and limitations affecting available choices.

## 2. Generate Comprehensive Options

1. Identify all viable alternatives through systematic option generation.

2. Include hybrid approaches combining multiple alternatives.

3. Explore innovative options beyond conventional choices.

4. Validate option feasibility against resource and operational constraints.

## 3. Assess Probabilities Systematically

1. Estimate likelihood of outcomes using base rates from historical data.

2. Incorporate expert judgment for scenarios without historical precedent.

3. Integrate market data and industry benchmarks for probability calibration.

4. Document probability assumptions and confidence levels.

## 4. Calculate Expected Values

1. Perform multi-dimensional value calculation including financial impacts.

2. Quantify strategic value beyond pure financial metrics.

3. Integrate risk factors into value calculations.

4. Create weighted value scores across multiple criteria.

## 5. Execute Sensitivity Analysis

1. Test critical assumptions affecting decision outcomes.

2. Perform break-even analysis for key variables.

3. Identify decision-critical parameters requiring additional validation.

4. Document assumption ranges and their impact on recommendations.

## 6. Conduct Risk Assessment

1. Identify comprehensive risks associated with each decision path.

2. Analyze potential impact of identified risks on outcomes.

3. Develop mitigation strategies for high-priority risks.

4. Quantify residual risk after mitigation measures.

## 7. Apply Optimization Engine

1. Perform multi-criteria decision analysis across all relevant dimensions.

2. Integrate stakeholder preferences into optimization framework.

3. Balance competing objectives through preference weighting.

4. Identify Pareto-optimal solutions where applicable.

## 8. Execute Advanced Analytics

1. Run Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic outcome distributions.

2. Apply real options valuation for decisions with flexibility value.

3. Optimize decision paths through dynamic programming approaches.

4. Perform robustness testing across different scenarios.

## 9. Develop Implementation Integration

1. Connect decision analysis to specific action plans and timelines.

2. Define success metrics and monitoring systems.

3. Create contingency plans for adverse scenario outcomes.

4. Establish decision checkpoints and review triggers.

## 10. Generate Complete Decision Tree Output

1. Document complete decision tree with all branches and outcomes.

2. Provide probability-weighted outcomes for each decision path.

3. Present expected value calculations with uncertainty ranges.

4. Deliver strategic recommendations with implementation guidance and risk management frameworks.
