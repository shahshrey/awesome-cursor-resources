<task name="Business Scenario Explorer">

<task_objective>
Explore multiple business timeline scenarios with comprehensive risk analysis and strategic optimization. Takes business context as input (market expansion, product launch, funding scenarios, or comprehensive business strategy), processes it through scenario frameworks including baseline, optimistic, pessimistic, disruption scenarios with constraint analysis and decision optimization, and generates a comprehensive scenario matrix with probability-weighted outcomes, strategic recommendations, risk mitigation strategies, and actionable decision frameworks.

# Business Scenario Explorer - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Gather Current Business Context

1. Analyze business model based on $ARGUMENTS analysis or existing documentation.

2. Review market conditions from @README.md or business documentation.

3. Collect financial data including historical performance and current metrics.

4. Assess competitive landscape through industry analysis and positioning.

## 2. Define Scenario Focus

1. Use $ARGUMENTS to determine specific analysis focus: market expansion, product launches, funding scenarios, or comprehensive business strategy.

2. Identify key variables and uncertain parameters that will drive scenario outcomes.

3. Determine appropriate time horizons for each scenario type.

## 3. Generate Baseline Scenario

1. Create most likely trajectory based on current performance and market conditions.

2. Model expected outcomes using historical data and current trends.

3. Establish baseline metrics for comparison with other scenarios.

## 4. Develop Optimistic Scenarios

1. Model best-case outcomes with favorable market conditions.

2. Incorporate successful execution assumptions and positive market responses.

3. Quantify upside potential with probability assessments.

## 5. Develop Pessimistic Scenarios

1. Model adverse conditions including increased competition.

2. Incorporate execution challenges and negative market responses.

3. Quantify downside risks with probability assessments.

## 6. Model Disruption Scenarios

1. Identify potential technology breakthroughs that could impact the business.

2. Model new entrant scenarios and competitive disruption.

3. Incorporate black swan events and low-probability high-impact scenarios.

## 7. Perform Constraint Analysis

1. Identify resource limitations affecting scenario outcomes.

2. Analyze regulatory factors and compliance requirements.

3. Model operational boundaries and capacity constraints.

## 8. Execute Advanced Analytics

1. Run Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic outcome distributions.

2. Perform sensitivity analysis on key variables.

3. Build decision trees for critical choice points.

4. Apply optimization algorithms to identify best strategies.

## 9. Integrate Strategic Recommendations

1. Link scenarios to specific decisions and resource allocation.

2. Develop contingency planning for different scenario outcomes.

3. Create risk-adjusted recommendations with implementation guidance.

## 10. Generate Comprehensive Output

1. Create scenario matrix with probability-weighted outcomes.

2. Document strategic recommendations for each scenario.

3. Provide risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans.

4. Deliver actionable decision frameworks for strategic implementation.
