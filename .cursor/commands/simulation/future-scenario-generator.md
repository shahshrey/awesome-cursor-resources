<task name="Future Scenario Generator">

<task_objective>
Generate comprehensive future scenarios with plausibility scoring, trend integration, and strategic implications. Takes time horizon as input (near-term, medium-term, long-term, or disruption-focused scenarios), processes it through scenario frameworks including trend analysis, scenario architecture, plausibility assessment, wild card integration, strategic implications, and monitoring, and generates a comprehensive scenario portfolio with plausibility scores, strategic implications, monitoring indicators, and decision frameworks for multiple future possibilities.

# Future Scenario Generator - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Establish Current Trend Context

1. Define time horizon based on $ARGUMENTS (1-2 years near-term, 3-5 years medium-term, 5-10+ years long-term).

2. Identify domain focus including industry, technology, society, or economic scenario generation.

3. Document existing trends including current patterns, trajectories, and emerging developments.

4. Identify key variables and major factors that could shape future outcomes.

## 2. Execute Comprehensive Trend Analysis

1. Identify multi-dimensional trends across technology domains.

2. Analyze social trends and demographic shifts.

3. Assess economic trends and market dynamics.

4. Review regulatory trends and policy developments.

## 3. Build Scenario Architecture

1. Develop baseline scenario based on current trajectory continuation.

2. Create optimistic scenario with favorable trend convergence.

3. Model pessimistic scenario with adverse developments.

4. Design transformation scenarios with fundamental system changes.

5. Perform cross-impact analysis to identify scenario interactions.

## 4. Assess Scenario Plausibility

1. Apply multi-criteria scoring based on historical precedent.

2. Evaluate logical consistency of scenario elements.

3. Incorporate expert validation and judgment.

4. Document plausibility scores with supporting rationale.

## 5. Integrate Wild Card Events

1. Identify low-probability, high-impact events relevant to scenarios.

2. Model disruption scenarios from technological breakthroughs.

3. Incorporate geopolitical shocks and regulatory disruptions.

4. Assess wild card interaction with baseline scenarios.

## 6. Derive Strategic Implications

1. Extract decision-relevant insights from each scenario.

2. Identify robust strategies effective across multiple scenarios.

3. Develop scenario-specific strategic options.

4. Create strategic hedge recommendations for uncertainty management.

## 7. Establish Monitoring Framework

1. Define early warning indicators for scenario unfolding.

2. Create scenario tracking systems for ongoing assessment.

3. Establish trigger points for strategic adjustments.

4. Implement continuous monitoring and updating processes.

## 8. Execute Advanced Features

1. Run Monte Carlo simulations for scenario probability distributions.

2. Model scenario interaction effects and convergence paths.

3. Calculate confidence intervals for scenario outcomes.

4. Implement adaptive scenario management for evolving conditions.

## 9. Integrate Decision Support

1. Connect scenarios to strategic planning processes.

2. Link scenario analysis to risk management frameworks.

3. Generate actionable recommendations for each scenario.

4. Create option generation frameworks based on scenario portfolio.

## 10. Generate Comprehensive Output

1. Deliver comprehensive scenario portfolio covering full range of possibilities.

2. Provide plausibility scores with transparent methodology.

3. Document strategic implications for decision-makers.

4. Deliver monitoring indicators and decision frameworks for adaptive strategy management across multiple future possibilities.
