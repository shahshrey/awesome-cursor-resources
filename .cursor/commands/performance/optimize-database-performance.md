<task name="Optimize Database Performance">

<task_objective>
Optimize database queries, indexing, and performance for improved response times and scalability. This workflow takes the database type as input (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB), analyzes current database performance and query patterns, implements optimizations including query rewriting, indexing, and schema design, and outputs comprehensive performance improvements with monitoring and validation.

# Optimize Database Performance - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Database Performance Analysis

1. Analyze current database performance and identify bottlenecks using monitoring tools.

2. Review slow query logs and execution plans to find problematic queries.

3. Assess database schema design and normalization level for optimization opportunities.

4. Evaluate indexing strategy and query patterns to identify missing indexes.

5. Monitor database resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O) to identify resource constraints.

## 2. Query Optimization

1. Identify and optimize slow-performing queries from slow query logs.

2. Analyze query execution plans and optimization strategies using EXPLAIN or equivalent.

3. Rewrite queries for better performance and efficiency using optimal SQL patterns.

4. Implement query hints and optimization directives where appropriate.

5. Configure query timeout and resource limits to prevent runaway queries.

## 3. Index Strategy Optimization

1. Analyze existing indexes and their usage patterns to identify unused indexes.

2. Design optimal indexing strategy for query patterns based on access frequency.

3. Create composite indexes for multi-column queries to improve query performance.

4. Implement covering indexes to avoid table lookups for frequently accessed columns.

5. Remove unused and redundant indexes to reduce write overhead.

## 4. Schema Design Optimization

1. Optimize table structure and data types for efficient storage and retrieval.

2. Implement denormalization strategies for read-heavy workloads to reduce joins.

3. Design partitioning strategies for large tables to improve query performance.

4. Create materialized views for complex aggregations that are frequently queried.

5. Optimize foreign key relationships and constraints for performance.

## 5. Connection Pool Optimization

1. Configure optimal database connection pooling settings based on workload.

2. Tune connection pool size and timeout settings to prevent connection exhaustion.

3. Implement connection monitoring and health checks to detect connection issues.

4. Optimize connection lifecycle and cleanup procedures to prevent leaks.

5. Configure connection security and SSL settings without impacting performance.

## 6. Query Result Caching

1. Implement intelligent database result caching for frequently accessed data.

2. Design cache invalidation strategies for data consistency when underlying data changes.

3. Set up query-level and result-set caching using Redis or application cache.

4. Configure cache expiration and refresh policies appropriate for data freshness needs.

5. Monitor cache effectiveness and hit rates to optimize cache configuration.

## 7. Database Monitoring and Profiling

1. Set up comprehensive database performance monitoring with dashboards.

2. Monitor query performance and resource usage in real-time.

3. Track database connections and session activity to prevent resource exhaustion.

4. Implement alerting for performance degradation and anomalies.

5. Configure automated performance reporting for stakeholders.

## 8. Read Replica and Load Balancing

1. Configure read replicas for query distribution to scale read operations.

2. Implement intelligent read/write query routing at the application level.

3. Set up load balancing across database instances for even distribution.

4. Monitor replication lag and consistency to ensure data accuracy.

5. Configure failover and disaster recovery procedures for high availability.

## 9. Database Vacuum and Maintenance

1. Implement automated database maintenance procedures (VACUUM, ANALYZE).

2. Configure vacuum and analyze operations for optimal performance in PostgreSQL.

3. Set up index rebuilding and maintenance schedules to prevent fragmentation.

4. Monitor table bloat and fragmentation to identify maintenance needs.

5. Implement automated cleanup and archival strategies for old data.

## 10. Performance Testing and Benchmarking

1. Set up database performance testing frameworks for consistent testing.

2. Implement load testing scenarios for realistic workloads.

3. Benchmark query performance under different conditions to validate optimizations.

4. Test database scalability and capacity limits before production issues.

5. Monitor performance regression and improvements with automated tests.
