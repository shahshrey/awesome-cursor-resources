# Simulate System Behavior - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Prerequisites Assessment

1. Validate system architecture and identify the type of system being simulated (Web Application, API Service, Data Processing, Database System, or Microservices).

2. Define performance goals including target metrics and SLAs (response time, throughput, availability, scalability).

3. Understand load characteristics and expected usage patterns including traffic profiles and user behavior.

4. Assess resource constraints including infrastructure and budget limitations.

5. Clarify optimization objectives to focus on the most critical performance aspects.

6. If context is unclear, systematically guide the user through architecture, performance goals, load characteristics, resource constraints, and optimization objectives.

## 2. System Architecture Modeling

1. Map application layer components including frontend components, application services, background services, and integration services.

2. Map data layer components including primary databases, cache systems, message queues, and search systems.

3. Map infrastructure layer components including load balancers, web servers, application servers, and network components.

4. Analyze synchronous interactions including request-response patterns, service mesh communication, database transactions, and external API calls.

5. Analyze asynchronous interactions including message queues, event streams, background jobs, and webhooks.

6. Document data flow patterns for read operations, write operations, batch processing, and real-time processing.

## 3. Load Modeling Framework

5. Perform cost-benefit analysis for performance improvement quantification, infrastructure cost implications, development effort estimation, and ROI calculation.

## 7. Capacity Planning Integration

1. Project growth including user growth, data growth, feature growth, and geographic growth projections.

2. Forecast resource requirements for compute resources, storage resources, network resources, and human resources.

3. Define scaling strategy including horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, auto-scaling, and manual scaling approaches.

4. Optimize costs through reserved capacity, spot instances, right-sizing, and multi-cloud strategies.

1. Generate performance summary with current capacity, bottleneck analysis, optimization potential, and scaling requirements.

2. Present load testing results in tabular format showing throughput, latency, error rate, and resource usage for different scenarios.

3. Provide detailed bottleneck analysis identifying primary and secondary bottlenecks, cascade effects, and resolution priority.

4. Deliver optimization recommendations organized by timeframe:
   - Immediate optimizations (0-30 days): quick wins, configuration tuning, query optimization, caching implementation
   - Medium-term optimizations (1-6 months): architecture changes, infrastructure upgrades, code refactoring, monitoring enhancement
   - Long-term optimizations (6+ months): technology migration, system redesign, capacity expansion, innovation integration

5. Document capacity planning including current capacity, growth accommodation, cost implications, and timeline requirements.

6. Define monitoring and alerting strategy with KPIs, alert thresholds, escalation procedures, and review schedules.
