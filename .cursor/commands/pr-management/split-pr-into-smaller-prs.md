# Split PR into Smaller PRs - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## Overview

This is an interactive agent-driven workflow for decomposing large PRs into smaller, reviewable chunks using GitHub MCP tools and intelligent analysis.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Backend-First Deployment**: Database ‚Üí Services ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend
2. **Optimal Size**: Ideally 1200 lines per PR (maximum 2000 lines - split further if exceeded)
3. **Tests Must Pass**: Every PR must have passing tests - include all dependencies needed
4. **Tests Included**: Tests MUST be in the same PR as the code they test - never separate
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Every PR independently deployable
6. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Fix issues, include dependencies; after 3 failures, request guidance

## Required Information from User

You need to provide:
1. **First commit SHA**: The first commit in your PR (exclusive - not included)
2. **Last commit SHA**: The last commit in your PR (inclusive)
3. **Linear ticket number**: Format `proj-[0-9]+` (e.g., proj-929)

**Branch Naming Convention**: `proj-XYZ-N-short-description`
- Example: `proj-929-1-database`, `proj-929-2-backend-services`

## 1. Update Main Branch (Critical First Step)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Always start with updated main branch to prevent merge conflicts.

1. Checkout main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Pull latest changes from origin:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Verify main is up to date.

**Why this matters**: Your decomposition will be integrated into main, so starting with the latest version prevents conflicts and ensures compatibility.

## 2. Gather PR Boundaries & Create Working State

1. Validate the commit range provided by user:
   - First commit SHA (exclusive)
   - Last commit SHA (inclusive)

2. Create a working branch with ALL changes:
```bash
   git checkout -b temp-decompose main
   git diff <first-commit>..<last-commit> | git apply
   ```

3. Execute all analysis operations in parallel for maximum efficiency:
   ```bash
git diff --stat <first-commit>..<last-commit> &
git diff <first-commit>..<last-commit> > full-changes.diff &
git log --oneline <first-commit>..<last-commit> &
git diff --name-only <first-commit>..<last-commit> | head -20 &
   wait
   ```

4. Analyze the complete diff as a whole with focus on:
   - **Coupling detection**: Files that break builds if separated
   - **Deployment boundaries**: Database ‚Üí backend ‚Üí frontend order
   - **Size optimization**: Target 1200 lines per PR (max 2000)

## 3. Dependency Detection & Test Requirements

Automatically detect dependencies based on:

### Deployment Order Priority

**Priority 1: Database migrations + ORM models (tightly coupled)**
  - Database migrations and ORM models MUST be in the same PR
  - These are tightly coupled - migrations without ORM updates are incomplete
  - ORM changes without migrations can break the application
  - This ensures database schema and code models stay synchronized

**Priority 2: Backend services (depends on ORM models)**

**Priority 3: API controllers (depends on services)**

**Priority 4: Frontend API clients (depends on API)**

**Priority 5: Frontend state (depends on API client)**

**Priority 6: UI components (depends on state)**

**Priority 10: Docs (independent)**

### Test Dependencies

  - Tests MUST be included in the same PR as the code they test
  - If tests import from other modules, those modules must be in the PR
  - Mock dependencies should be minimized
  - Each PR should run pytest successfully
  - Frontend PRs should pass npm test
  - NEVER create separate test-only PRs - tests go with their code

## 4. Test-Driven Decomposition Analysis

Before creating the plan, verify test dependencies:

1. Check which tests depend on which modules:
   ```bash
   grep -r "from your_api" tests/ | grep -E "(feature1|feature2|feature3)"
   ```

2. Verify import chains:
```bash
python -c "import ast; ..." # Parse imports to understand dependencies
   ```

3. Run tests to identify what breaks when modules are missing:
   ```bash
pytest tests/specific_module/ -v
   ```

4. **Critical**: Ensure each PR can pass tests independently.
   - If tests fail, include ALL necessary dependencies in that PR
   - NEVER skip tests with --no-verify

## 5. Strategy Selection

Choose the optimal strategy:

**PARALLEL**: For independent changes (fastest review)
- Changes don't depend on each other
- Can be merged in any order
- Enables concurrent reviews

**STACKED**: For dependent features (clear chain)
- Changes have dependencies
- Must merge in specific order
- Clear dependency chain

**HYBRID**: Mix of both (recommended default)
- Some changes independent
- Some changes dependent
- Optimizes for speed and safety

## 6. Interactive Plan Review

Present a decomposition plan to the user:

```
üìä Proposed PR Decomposition:

PR 1: Database Infrastructure + ORM Models (650 lines)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Independent - Can merge anytime
  ‚îî‚îÄ Files: migrations/*.sql, orm.py, models/*.py
  ‚îî‚îÄ Note: Database migrations and ORM MUST be together

PR 2: Backend Services (1,200 lines)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Depends on: PR 1
  ‚îî‚îÄ Files: services/*.py, business logic

PR 3: API Layer (980 lines)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Depends on: PR 2
  ‚îî‚îÄ Files: controllers/*.py, routers.py

PR 4: Frontend (1,400 lines) - NEEDS SPLIT
  ‚îú‚îÄ PR 4a: State Management + tests (720 lines)
  ‚îî‚îÄ PR 4b: UI Components + tests (720 lines)

Total: 4 PRs, ~4,270 lines
Note: Tests are ALWAYS included with their respective code PRs
Note: Database + ORM are atomic - never split them
```

Ask user for approval before proceeding.

## 7. Branch and PR Creation with GitHub Integration

Upon user approval, execute comprehensive PR creation:

### Extract Logical Groups

For each PR:

1. Create branch from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b proj-929-1-database main
   ```

2. Get all changes from temp branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout temp-decompose -- .
   ```

3. Reset to unstage everything:
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD
   ```

4. Selectively stage only relevant files:
   ```bash
   git add migrations/*.sql
   git add **/orm.py
   git add **/models.py
   ```

5. Commit as a logical unit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(database): add feature settings infrastructure"
   ```

### Verify Tests Before Committing

**For Python changes:**
   ```bash
   cd libs/python/your-api
   poetry run pytest tests/relevant_module/ -v
```

**For frontend changes:**
```bash
   cd services/your-web
   npm test
```

**If tests fail:**
- Include minimal additional dependencies
- Fix any code issues
- Re-run tests

### Pre-commit Hook Execution

1. Run commit with pre-commit hooks enabled (default):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(component): description"
   ```

2. When pre-commit hooks report issues:
   - Fix linting and formatting issues identified
   - Include dependencies required for tests to pass
   - Correct any code issues found by hooks
   - Re-run the commit command

3. After 3 unsuccessful attempts:
   - Request user guidance with specific error details
   - Provide exact test failures or linting issues
   - Suggest potential solutions based on errors

**Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality by:**
- Running tests to verify functionality
- Checking code formatting consistency
- Validating linting rules
- Ensuring type safety where applicable

### Create Clean, Logical Commits

Format commit messages with ticket number:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(database): [PROJ-929] add feature settings infrastructure"
```

Organize commits by logical functionality that form complete features.

### Push Branches

Use consistent branch naming format:
   ```bash
   git push origin proj-929-1-database
git push origin proj-929-2-backend-services
   ```

### Generate PR Summaries and Create GitHub PRs

1. For each branch, generate AI-powered summary:
   ```bash
   git checkout proj-929-1-database
   git fetch origin main
   git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat | cat
   git diff origin/main...HEAD | cat
   ```

2. Use the `@generate-pr-summary.md` workflow to create comprehensive description.

3. Use GitHub MCP tools to:
   - Auto-detect repository owner and name from git remote
   - Generate AI-powered summaries for each branch
   - Create all PRs in parallel for maximum efficiency
   - Include in each PR:
     * Title format: `[AVA-929] [X/Y] Component Description`
     * Comprehensive AI-generated body with:
       - Summary of changes
       - Linear ticket link
       - Dependencies and merge order
       - Testing recommendations
       - Deployment notes
     * Proper base branch (main or previous PR for stacked)
     * Draft status for initial review
   - Return links to all created PRs with GitHub URLs

### Set Up PR Dependencies

For stacked PRs, automatically update PR base branches:
- PR 2 will have base set to `proj-929-1-database` instead of `main`
- Creates clear dependency chain

### Clean Up Temporary Branches

```bash
git branch -D temp-working temp-decompose 2>/dev/null || true
```

## 8. Automated PR Body Generation

Each PR will automatically receive a comprehensive body:

```markdown
