# Decision Quality Analyzer - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Current Decision Context Analysis

1. Count active contributors using `git log --format='%ae' --since='1 month ago' | sort -u | wc -l`
2. Identify recent decisions from major commits and discussions
3. Analyze decision frequency through pattern analysis of decision-making cadence
4. Assess process maturity by evaluating current decision frameworks and methodologies in use
5. Use $ARGUMENTS for: bias-detection, scenario-testing, process-optimization, or outcome-tracking

## 2. Process Quality Assessment

1. Evaluate information gathering completeness and quality
2. Assess stakeholder involvement and representation
3. Review alternative generation breadth and creativity
4. Measure analysis rigor and decision criteria

## 3. Bias Detection Analysis

1. Identify confirmation bias patterns (seeking supporting evidence)
2. Detect anchoring bias (over-reliance on first information)
3. Recognize groupthink tendencies (pressure for consensus)
4. Identify authority bias (deferring to senior opinions)
5. Detect planning fallacy patterns (underestimating time/resources)

## 4. Outcome Evaluation

1. Assess goal achievement against intended outcomes
2. Identify unintended consequences of decisions
3. Measure stakeholder satisfaction with results
4. Evaluate sustainability measures for long-term impact

## 5. Scenario Testing

1. Conduct historical decision analysis to learn from past
2. Perform hypothetical scenario testing for robustness
3. Run stress test scenarios for edge cases
4. Extract learning from decision outcomes

## 6. Timing Analysis

1. Evaluate decision speed (too fast vs too slow)
2. Optimize information timing for decision-making
3. Coordinate implementation timing
4. Schedule review timing for feedback loops

## 7. Learning Integration

1. Capture knowledge from decision outcomes
2. Build institutional learning systems
3. Implement process improvement based on learnings
4. Develop capability building programs

## 8. Advanced Features

1. Multi-dimensional quality metrics measurement
2. Systematic bias mitigation strategies
3. Decision simulation testing capabilities
4. Predictive outcome modeling

## 9. Process Optimization

1. Stakeholder engagement frameworks development
2. Analytical tool integration for better analysis
3. Communication enhancement strategies
4. Cultural development strategies for decision-making
