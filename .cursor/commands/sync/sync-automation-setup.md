# Sync Automation Setup - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## Prerequisites and Context

**Available Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash

**Argument Options**: [setup-mode] | --full | --webhooks-only | --monitoring | --deploy-target

**Model**: sonnet

## Current Infrastructure State

- GitHub CLI: !`gh --version 2>/dev/null && echo "✓ Available" || echo "⚠ Not available"`
- Linear MCP: Check Linear MCP server availability and configuration
- Infrastructure: Docker, webhook endpoints, database connectivity, queue services
- CI/CD: !`find . -name ".github" -o -name ".gitlab-ci.yml" -o -name "azure-pipelines.yml" | wc -l` existing workflows

## 1. Prerequisites Setup

Validate and prepare infrastructure:

**Validate GitHub/Linear Access**:
- Verify GitHub CLI authentication and permissions
- Test GitHub API access with required scopes
- Validate Linear API key and access
- Check Linear MCP server connectivity

**Check Infrastructure Requirements**:
- Verify server or hosting platform availability
- Check Node.js/Python runtime versions
- Validate network connectivity and firewall rules
- Ensure adequate storage and compute resources

**Configure Authentication**:
- Set up GitHub Personal Access Token with repo and webhook scopes
- Configure Linear API key with read/write permissions
- Store credentials securely (environment variables, secrets manager)
- Test authentication for both platforms

**Test Connectivity**:
- Perform test API calls to GitHub
- Perform test API calls to Linear
- Verify webhook endpoint accessibility
- Check database connectivity

## 2. Webhook Configuration

Setup real-time event processing:

**Setup GitHub/Linear Webhooks**:
- Create GitHub webhook for repository events
- Subscribe to relevant events (issues, pull_requests, issue_comment)
- Configure Linear webhook for task events
- Set webhook secret for security

**Configure Endpoints**:
- Deploy webhook receiver service
- Set up HTTP endpoint with proper routing
- Configure HTTPS and SSL certificates
- Implement request validation

**Implement Security**:
- Validate webhook signatures using shared secret
- Implement IP allowlisting if applicable
- Add rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit

**Test Delivery**:
- Send test webhook events from GitHub
- Send test webhook events from Linear
- Verify event reception and parsing
- Validate event processing pipeline

## 3. CI/CD Integration

Automate sync operations:

**Create GitHub Actions Workflows**:
- Define workflow file (.github/workflows/sync.yml)
- Configure workflow triggers (schedule, manual, webhook)
- Set up job steps for sync operations
- Define environment variables and secrets

**Setup Scheduled Syncs**:
- Configure cron schedules for periodic syncs
- Set up full sync intervals (e.g., daily at midnight)
- Configure incremental sync frequency (e.g., hourly)
- Implement health check schedules

**Implement Event Handling**:
- Create event-driven workflow triggers
- Handle GitHub issue events
- Handle Linear task events
- Process PR and comment events

**Configure Deployments**:
- Set up deployment pipeline for sync service
- Configure staging and production environments
- Implement blue-green or canary deployments
- Set up rollback procedures

## 4. Sync Server Deployment

Deploy synchronization engine:

**Configure Sync Engine**:
- Deploy sync service application
- Configure sync logic and rules
- Set up field mapping configurations
- Define conflict resolution strategies

**Setup Queue Management**:
- Deploy message queue (Redis, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- Configure queue workers
- Implement job prioritization
- Set up dead letter queues for failures

**Implement Error Handling**:
- Define error categories and handling strategies
- Configure retry logic with exponential backoff
- Set up error logging and tracking
- Implement alerting for critical errors

**Enable Monitoring**:
- Install monitoring agents
- Configure application metrics collection
- Set up log aggregation
- Enable distributed tracing

## 5. Database & State Management

Manage sync state persistence:

**Initialize Sync Databases**:
- Deploy database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- Create connection configuration
- Set up connection pooling
- Configure backup schedules

**Setup Schema**:
- Define entity mapping tables
- Create sync state tracking tables
- Set up audit log tables
- Implement indexes for performance

**Configure Backups**:
- Set up automated database backups
- Configure backup retention policies
- Test restore procedures
- Implement point-in-time recovery

**Implement State Tracking**:
- Track last sync timestamps
- Store entity version information
- Maintain sync queue state
- Record operation history

## 6. Monitoring & Alerting

Implement observability:

**Configure Dashboards**:
- Deploy monitoring dashboard (Grafana, Datadog, CloudWatch)
- Create sync performance metrics visualizations
- Display error rates and trends
- Show queue depth and processing times

**Setup Alerts**:
- Configure alert rules for critical conditions
- Set thresholds for error rates
- Define SLAs for sync latency
- Create escalation policies

**Implement Health Checks**:
- Create endpoint for health status
- Monitor service availability
- Check dependency health (GitHub, Linear, database)
- Implement readiness and liveness probes

**Enable Notifications**:
- Configure notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
- Set up alert routing rules
- Define notification frequencies
- Implement alert aggregation

## Advanced Features

**Real-time Webhook Processing**:
