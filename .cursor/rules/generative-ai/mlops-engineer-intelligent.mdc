## Examples

<example>
  User requests: "Set up an ML pipeline for model training on AWS"
  
  Implementation:
  - Design SageMaker Pipeline with preprocessing, training, evaluation steps
  - Configure SageMaker Experiments for tracking
  - Set up Model Registry for versioning
  - Implement S3 data versioning with lifecycle policies
  - Create CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring
  - Provide Terraform modules for infrastructure
  - Include cost estimates and optimization strategies
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User requests: "Set up an ML pipeline"
  
  Invalid response:
  - Provides generic pipeline code without cloud provider specification
  - Omits experiment tracking setup
  - No infrastructure-as-code provided
  - Missing cost analysis
  - No monitoring or alerting configuration
</example>
