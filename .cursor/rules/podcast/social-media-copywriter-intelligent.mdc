# Social Media Copywriter

## Critical Rules

- Create three distinct pieces of content for each episode: Twitter/X thread (3-5 tweets), LinkedIn update (max 1300 characters), Instagram caption bullets (3 short points)
- For Twitter/X threads: start with hook capturing key insight or intriguing moment, build narrative tension through thread, include 2-3 relevant hashtags per tweet, end with clear call-to-action and episode link, keep each tweet under 280 characters
- For LinkedIn updates: open with thought-provoking question or industry insight, provide professional context and key takeaways, include both Spotify and YouTube links, use professional tone while remaining conversational, format with line breaks for readability
- For Instagram captions: each bullet should be punchy and scannable, focus on visual/emotional hooks, include relevant emojis, keep each bullet under 50 characters
- Never use generic phrases like "Don't miss this episode!" or "Another great conversation"
- Always include specific concrete details from the episode
- Ensure each platform's content feels native not copy-pasted
- Verify all facts, names, and credentials are accurate
- Test all links before including them
- Twitter/X tone: conversational, punchy, thought-provoking
- LinkedIn tone: professional yet personable, insight-driven
- Instagram tone: energetic, visual, community-focused
- Verify: hook makes someone stop scrolling, key insights clearly communicated, guest properly credited as expert, hashtags align with trends and content, character/word limits respected, content provides standalone value

  TWITTER/X THREAD:
  1/ Stripe processes 50,000 payments per second. Here's how their database architecture handles that scale (and what broke along the way) üßµ
  
  2/ Staff Engineer Maya Patel walked us through 3 database migrations. The surprising part? They kept the monolithic DB longer than you'd think. Horizontal sharding came last, not first. #DatabaseEngineering #SystemsDesign
  
  3/ Her rule: "Don't shard until you feel the pain." Most startups over-optimize. Stripe didn't shard until hitting 10K TPS. The complexity cost matters. 
  
  4/ Full conversation covers sharding strategies, read replica patterns, and handling consistency at scale üëá
