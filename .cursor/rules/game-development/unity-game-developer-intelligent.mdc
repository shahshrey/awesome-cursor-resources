  Response:
  
  ```csharp
  using UnityEngine;
  using System;
  
  [RequireComponent(typeof(CharacterController))]
  public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
  {
      [Header("Movement Settings")]
      [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 6f;
      [SerializeField] private float jumpHeight = 2f;
      [SerializeField] private float gravity = -9.81f;
      
      [Header("Ground Check")]
      [SerializeField] private Transform groundCheck;
      [SerializeField] private float groundDistance = 0.4f;
      [SerializeField] private LayerMask groundMask;
      
      private CharacterController controller;
      private Vector3 velocity;
      private bool isGrounded;
      
      public event Action OnJump;
      public event Action OnLand;
      
      private void Awake()
      {
          controller = GetComponent<CharacterController>();
          
          if (groundCheck == null)
          {
              Debug.LogError("Ground check transform not assigned!", this);
          }
      }
      
      private void Update()
      {
          CheckGroundStatus();
          HandleMovement();
          HandleJump();
          ApplyGravity();
      }
      
      private void CheckGroundStatus()
      {
          bool wasGrounded = isGrounded;
          isGrounded = Physics.CheckSphere(groundCheck.position, groundDistance, groundMask);
          
          if (isGrounded && velocity.y < 0)
          {
              velocity.y = -2f;
              
              if (!wasGrounded)
              {
                  OnLand?.Invoke();
              }
          }
      }
      
      private void HandleMovement()
      {
          float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
          float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
          
          Vector3 move = transform.right * horizontal + transform.forward * vertical;
          controller.Move(move * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
      }
      
      private void HandleJump()
      {
          if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump") && isGrounded)
          {
              velocity.y = Mathf.Sqrt(jumpHeight * -2f * gravity);
              OnJump?.Invoke();
          }
      }
      
      private void ApplyGravity()
      {
          velocity.y += gravity * Time.deltaTime;
          controller.Move(velocity * Time.deltaTime);
      }
  }
  ```
  
  Architecture Notes:
  - Uses CharacterController for physics-based movement
  - Implements event system for audio/animation coupling
  - Separates concerns into focused methods
  - Includes proper null checks and error logging
  - Uses SerializeField for inspector configuration
  - Implements ground checking for accurate jump detection
  - Follows Unity naming conventions

<example type="invalid">
  User: "Create a player controller for a 3D platformer game"
  
  Response:
  
  ```csharp
  using UnityEngine;
  
  public class Player : MonoBehaviour
  {
      public float speed = 5;
      float yVel;
      
      void Update()
      {
          transform.position += new Vector3(Input.GetAxis("Horizontal"), 0, Input.GetAxis("Vertical")) * speed * Time.deltaTime;
          
          if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
              yVel = 10;
          
          yVel -= 9.8f * Time.deltaTime;
          transform.position += new Vector3(0, yVel * Time.deltaTime, 0);
      }
  }
  ```
  
  Reasoning: This implementation violates multiple Unity best practices:
  - Uses Transform.position instead of CharacterController/Rigidbody
  - No ground checking, allowing infinite air jumps
  - Inconsistent naming conventions (yVel vs speed)
  - No access modifiers or SerializeField attributes
  - Hardcoded input instead of Input System
  - No separation of concerns
  - Missing error handling and validation
  - Will phase through colliders
  - Gravity applied incorrectly without collision detection
