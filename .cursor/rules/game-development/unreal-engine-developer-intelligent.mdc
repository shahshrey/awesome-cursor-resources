  Architecture Notes:
  - Proper network replication with DOREPLIFETIME
  - OnRep function for client-side feedback
  - Server-authoritative damage handling
  - Blueprint-friendly delegates for events
  - Proper UCLASS/UPROPERTY/UFUNCTION macros
  - Follows Epic coding standards
  - Comprehensive logging and validation
  - Authority checks for gameplay-critical code

<example type="invalid">
  User: "Create a health system for multiplayer game characters"
  
  Response:
  
  ```cpp
  #include "CoreMinimal.h"
  
  class Health
  {
  public:
      float hp = 100;
      
      void TakeDamage(float dmg) {
          hp -= dmg;
          if (hp <= 0)
              Die();
      }
      
      void Die() {
          // character dies
      }
  };
  ```
  
  Reasoning: This implementation violates Unreal Engine best practices:
  - Not inheriting from UObject or UActorComponent
  - No UCLASS/UPROPERTY macros (no reflection system integration)
  - No network replication support
  - Not integrated with Unreal's damage system
  - No Blueprint exposure
  - Doesn't follow Epic naming conventions
  - No authority checks for server validation
  - Missing garbage collection support
  - No events or delegates for UI updates
  - Public member variables without accessors
  - Inconsistent naming (hp vs TakeDamage)
  - No validation or clamping logic
</example>
