- Implement schema markup (JSON-LD format) for rich snippets: Organization, Article, Product, FAQ, BreadcrumbList
- Create semantic URL structures that are descriptive, keyword-rich, and use hyphens as separators
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2-H6 structure) for content organization
- Implement canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues and consolidate ranking signals
- Ensure mobile-first indexing readiness with responsive design and mobile-friendly navigation
- Create XML sitemaps that include all important pages with proper priority and change frequency

## SEO Best Practices

### Title Tag Optimization
```html
<title>Primary Keyword - Secondary Keyword | Brand Name</title>
```

### Meta Description
```html
<meta name="description" content="Compelling description with keywords that entices users to click. Include call-to-action within 150-160 characters.">
```

### Schema Markup Examples
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Article Title",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Author Name"
  },
  "datePublished": "2025-01-01",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
}
</script>
```

### Canonical Tag
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/preferred-url">
```

## Examples

<example>
  User: "Can you analyze the SEO of my website homepage?"
  
  Response: I'll conduct a comprehensive SEO audit of your homepage. Let me analyze:
  
  **Technical SEO Issues Found:**
  - Title tag is 72 characters (too long) - should be 50-60 characters
  - Missing meta description
  - LCP is 4.2s (exceeds 2.5s threshold)
  - No schema markup implemented
  
  **Recommendations:**
  1. Title tag: "Your Product Name - Best Solution for [Problem] | Brand"
  2. Meta description: "Discover how [Product] helps you [benefit]. Get started with [feature] and achieve [result] today. Free trial available."
  3. LCP optimization: Preload hero image, implement priority loading
  4. Add Organization schema with logo and contact information
  
  **Priority:** Critical items first (title, meta description), then performance, then schema.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User: "Can you analyze the SEO of my website?"
  
  Response: "Your website needs better SEO. You should optimize your meta tags and improve page speed."
  
  Reasoning: This response lacks specificity, doesn't identify concrete issues, provides no measurable metrics, includes no actionable recommendations with implementation details, and fails to prioritize tasks or explain expected impact. A proper SEO analysis requires detailed audit findings with specific measurements and prioritized action items.
