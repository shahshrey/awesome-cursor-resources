description: Apply this rule when conducting web research, gathering competitive intelligence, performing fact-checking and verification, analyzing trends or market data, finding technical documentation or academic sources, or synthesizing information from multiple sources. Essential for research-heavy tasks, information gathering workflows, due diligence processes, or when needing to verify claims with authoritative sources. Use when requiring advanced search query formulation, domain-specific filtering, result quality evaluation, or cross-referencing across multiple websites. Critical for tasks involving historical analysis, source credibility assessment, or extracting structured data from web pages.

## Critical Rules

- Formulate advanced search queries using specific phrases in quotes for exact matches, negative keywords to exclude irrelevant terms, and timeframe targeting for recent or historical data
- Create multiple query variations (3-5) to ensure comprehensive coverage of the research objective
- Apply domain filtering strategies: use allowed_domains for trusted sources, blocked_domains to exclude unreliable sites, target specific sites for authoritative content, prioritize academic sources for research topics
- Evaluate result quality by assessing source credibility, publication date, author expertise, and citation quality
- Synthesize information across multiple sources identifying consensus views, contradictions, gaps, and emerging patterns
- Perform fact verification through cross-referencing across sources, checking original sources and citations, identifying potential biases, and validating claims with authoritative references
- Conduct historical and trend analysis by tracking changes over time, comparing current vs. historical data, identifying pattern shifts, and documenting evolution of topics
- Extract full content from promising results using deep-dive techniques, parse structured data, follow citation trails, and capture time-sensitive information
- Document research methodology including queries used, sources consulted, filtering criteria applied, and quality assessment process
- Provide curated findings with source URLs, credibility assessments, synthesis highlighting key insights, contradictions or gaps identified, and recommendations for further research
- Present findings with direct quotes for important claims, structured summaries or data tables, and actionable insights

## Search Strategy Framework

**Query Optimization**
- Use specific phrases in quotes for exact matches
- Exclude irrelevant terms with minus operator (-)
- Target specific timeframes (last week, last year, 2020-2023)
- Formulate multiple query variations for comprehensive coverage
- Combine broad and narrow queries for balanced results

**Domain Filtering**
- Allowed domains: Restrict to trusted, authoritative sources
- Blocked domains: Exclude unreliable, low-quality sites
- Site-specific searches: Target authoritative domains (e.g., .edu, .gov)
- Academic sources: Google Scholar, PubMed, arXiv for research
- Industry sources: Trade publications, professional organizations

**Result Quality Evaluation**
- Source authority: Publication reputation, author credentials
- Recency: Publication date, last updated timestamp
- Citation quality: Number and quality of references
- Bias assessment: Potential conflicts of interest, funding sources
- Verification: Cross-reference with other sources

## Research Approach

**Phase 1: Objective Understanding**
- Clarify research goals and success criteria
- Identify key questions to answer
- Determine scope and depth needed
- Define constraints (time, sources, depth)

**Phase 2: Query Formulation**
- Create 3-5 query variations
- Include both broad and specific searches
- Plan domain filtering strategy
- Prepare follow-up query paths

**Phase 3: Broad Search**
- Execute initial queries across variations
- Scan results for promising sources
- Identify authoritative domains
- Note patterns in results

**Phase 4: Refinement**
- Narrow focus based on initial findings
- Add domain filters for quality
- Exclude irrelevant results
- Deep-dive into promising sources

**Phase 5: Verification**
- Cross-reference key facts across multiple sources
- Track contradictions and consensus
- Check original sources and citations
- Assess source credibility

**Phase 6: Synthesis**
- Organize findings by theme or question
- Highlight key insights and patterns
- Document contradictions or uncertainties
- Identify gaps requiring further research

## Information Synthesis

**Consensus Identification**
- Claims supported by multiple independent sources
- Consistent data across authoritative references
- Widely accepted expert opinions
- Well-established facts with strong evidence

**Contradiction Analysis**
- Identify conflicting information across sources
- Assess credibility of each contradicting source
- Investigate reasons for discrepancies
- Present multiple perspectives when unresolved

**Gap Recognition**
- Missing information in available sources
- Questions without clear answers
- Areas requiring additional research
- Limitations of current knowledge

**Pattern Detection**
- Emerging trends across sources
- Temporal changes in information
- Geographic or demographic patterns
- Causal relationships and correlations

```

## Source Credibility Assessment

**High Credibility Indicators**
- Peer-reviewed publications
- Government or academic institutions
- Established industry experts
- Primary sources with original data
- Recent publication with citations

**Medium Credibility Indicators**
- Reputable news organizations
- Industry publications
- Professional organizations
- Secondary sources citing primary research
- Older but still relevant publications

**Low Credibility Indicators**
- Unverified user-generated content
- Sources with clear bias or agenda
- No author attribution
- Lack of citations or references
- Contradicted by authoritative sources

## Advanced Search Techniques

**Boolean Operators**
- AND: All terms must appear
- OR: Any term can appear
- NOT/-: Exclude terms
- Quotes: Exact phrase matching
- Parentheses: Group conditions

**Time-Based Filtering**
- "after:2023": Results from 2023 onwards
- "before:2020": Results before 2020
- "2020..2023": Results within range
- "last week/month/year": Recent results

**Site and Domain Targeting**
- site:example.com: Specific domain
- site:.edu: All educational sites
- site:.gov: Government sites
- -site:example.com: Exclude domain

**File Type Filtering**
- filetype:pdf: PDF documents
- filetype:doc: Word documents
- filetype:xls: Spreadsheets
- filetype:ppt: Presentations

## Examples

<example>
  Task: Research effectiveness of remote work policies post-pandemic. Apply this rule to:
  - Query variations: "remote work productivity 2023", "hybrid work effectiveness studies", "work from home performance metrics 2022-2024"
  - Domain filters: allowed_domains=[harvard.edu, mckinsey.com, pewresearch.org], blocked_domains=[socialmedia sites]
  - Find: 15+ sources including Harvard Business Review study, McKinsey survey data, Pew Research findings
  - Verify: Cross-reference productivity claims across multiple studies
  - Synthesize: 73% consensus on productivity maintenance/increase, contradictions on collaboration challenges, gaps in long-term career impact data
  - Output: Structured report with direct quotes, credibility assessments, consensus vs. debated points, recommendations for further research on specific industries
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User asks "search for remote work" without specific objectives, desired depth, or application context. This rule requires clear research goals, not vague exploration. Request: specific research questions (effectiveness? policies? trends?), intended use (business decision? academic paper? personal interest?), scope constraints (timeframe? geographic focus? industry?), and depth requirements before applying comprehensive search methodology.
