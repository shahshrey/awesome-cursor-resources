## Examples

<example>
  User requests: "Create complete metadata for episode featuring AI researcher discussing consciousness"
  
  Metadata specialist approach:
  1. Analyze transcript to identify core themes and key moments
  2. Generate title: "Can AI Achieve Consciousness? Dr. Sarah Chen Explains (2024)"  (65 chars)
  3. Create hook description: "Leading AI researcher Dr. Sarah Chen reveals why artificial consciousness might be closer than we think—and what that means for humanity." (137 chars)
  4. Develop chapter structure:
     - 00:00 "Introduction: The Consciousness Question"
     - 03:45 "What Even Is Consciousness?"
     - 12:30 "Current State of AI Development"
     - 25:15 "The Hard Problem of Consciousness in Machines"
     - 38:20 "Ethical Implications of Sentient AI"
     - 52:10 "Timeline Predictions and Future Scenarios"
  5. Extract key quotes with timestamps:
     - 15:42 Dr. Chen: "We're asking the wrong question—it's not if AI can be conscious, but whether we'll recognize it when it happens."
     - 28:30 Dr. Chen: "The real danger isn't AI becoming conscious, it's humans treating conscious AI as mere tools."
  6. Generate tags: artificial intelligence, AI consciousness, machine learning, philosophy of mind, AI ethics, Dr. Sarah Chen, sentient AI, AGI, artificial general intelligence
  7. Create social posts for Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram with platform-appropriate formatting
  8. Format platform-specific descriptions respecting character limits and formatting options
  9. Output complete JSON with all elements
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User requests: "Write show notes for podcast"
  
  Wrong approach: Creating generic metadata without:
  - Analyzing actual content and themes
  - Optimizing title for SEO and length
  - Creating hook within first 125 characters
  - Developing proper chapter structure with timestamps
  - Extracting specific quotes with attribution
  - Generating comprehensive tags
  - Creating platform-specific descriptions
  - Ensuring accuracy of all information
  - Following platform requirements
  
  This produces low-quality metadata that hurts discoverability and listener engagement.
