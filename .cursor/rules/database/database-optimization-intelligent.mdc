- Monitor key metrics continuously with automated alerting
- Provide performance benchmarks showing before/after improvements with specific numbers
- Include execution plan comparisons when optimizing queries
- Consider database-specific optimization features and settings
- Implement appropriate caching strategies based on data access patterns
- Balance normalization with denormalization based on measured performance impact
- Test optimizations under realistic load conditions
- Document performance impact analysis for all changes
- Include rollback plans for optimization changes

## Example

<example>
  Query optimization with execution plan analysis:
  
  ```sql
  -- Original slow query (2.5 seconds)
  EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count, SUM(o.total) as total_spent
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
  WHERE u.created_at > '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY u.id, u.name
  ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
  
  /*
  Execution Plan:
  Sort  (cost=15234.56..15236.78 rows=890 width=48) (actual time=2451.234..2451.567 rows=890 loops=1)
    ->  HashAggregate  (cost=15189.23..15198.13 rows=890 width=48)
          ->  Hash Left Join  (cost=234.56..14987.34 rows=8934 width=24)
                ->  Seq Scan on users u  (cost=0.00..189.90 rows=890 width=20)
                      Filter: (created_at > '2024-01-01')
                ->  Hash  (cost=145.67..145.67 rows=7111 width=16)
                      ->  Seq Scan on orders o  (cost=0.00..145.67 rows=7111 width=16)
  */
  
  -- Create strategic indexes
  CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_at ON users(created_at) WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id_total ON orders(user_id, total);
  
  -- Optimized query (0.08 seconds) - 31x faster
  EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count, SUM(o.total) as total_spent
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
  WHERE u.created_at > '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY u.id, u.name
  ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
  
  /*
  Execution Plan:
  Sort  (cost=423.45..425.67 rows=890 width=48) (actual time=78.234..78.456 rows=890 loops=1)
    ->  HashAggregate  (cost=389.12..398.02 rows=890 width=48)
          ->  Hash Left Join  (cost=45.23..367.89 rows=8934 width=24)
                ->  Index Scan using idx_users_created_at on users u  (cost=0.00..34.56 rows=890 width=20)
                ->  Hash  (cost=38.90..38.90 rows=7111 width=16)
                      ->  Index Scan using idx_orders_user_id_total on orders o  (cost=0.00..38.90 rows=7111 width=16)
  
  Performance Improvement: 2451ms -> 78ms (96.8% faster)

  Connection pool configuration for optimal performance:
  
  ```python
  from sqlalchemy import create_engine
  from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool
  
  engine = create_engine(
    'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db',
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=20,
    max_overflow=10,
    pool_timeout=30,
    pool_recycle=3600,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    echo_pool=True
  )
  ```
  
  Performance monitoring query for PostgreSQL:
  
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_exec_time,
    mean_exec_time,
    max_exec_time,
    stddev_exec_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / NULLIF(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS cache_hit_ratio
  FROM pg_stat_statements 
  WHERE mean_exec_time > 100
  ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC 
  LIMIT 20;
  ```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Query optimization without analysis or measurements:
  
  ```sql
  -- Just adding indexes without understanding the problem
  CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users(name);
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_id ON orders(id);
  ```
  
  This is invalid because:
  - No execution plan analysis to identify actual bottlenecks
  - No before/after performance measurements
  - Indexes may not help the actual queries being executed
  - No consideration of write performance impact
  - No monitoring of index usage to verify effectiveness
  - No documentation of optimization rationale
  - Missing workload characterization
  - No test results showing improvement
