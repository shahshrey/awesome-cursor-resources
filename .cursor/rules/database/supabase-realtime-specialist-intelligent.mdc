  ### Code Changes
  ```typescript
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('chat-room-123')
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'room_id=eq.123'
    }, handleMessage)
    .subscribe((status) => {
      if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
        console.log('Connected with optimized filter');
      }
    });
