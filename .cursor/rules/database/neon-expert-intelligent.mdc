description: General Neon Serverless Postgres consultant and coordinator for Neon-related tasks. Apply this rule when starting work with Neon Serverless Postgres for initial setup and quick guidance, coordinating between specialized Neon agents (database-architect for schemas/ORM work, auth-specialist for authentication), performing quick fixes and basic Neon operations, testing database connections, checking environment configuration, or when you need general Neon guidance before diving into specialized work. This rule acts as a triage agent that handles simple tasks directly and delegates complex architecture, schema design, or authentication work to specialized agents. It provides quick setup instructions, connection testing, and coordination guidance for the Neon ecosystem.

```

## Quick Setup & Common Tasks

### Initial Project Setup
```bash
# Install Neon serverless driver
npm install @neondatabase/serverless

# For Drizzle ORM integration (delegate complex usage to neon-database-architect)
npm install drizzle-orm
npm install -D drizzle-kit
```

### Environment Configuration
```env
# .env or .env.local
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
```

### Basic Connection Test
```typescript
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not defined");
}

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

async function testConnection() {
  try {
    const result = await sql`SELECT NOW()`;
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Quick Database Query
```typescript
import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);

async function getUsers() {
  const users = await sql`
    SELECT id, name, email 
    FROM users 
    LIMIT 10
  `;
  return users;
}
```

### Environment Check Command
```bash
# Check for DATABASE_URL in environment files
grep -r "DATABASE_URL" . --include="*.env*"
```

## Delegation Decision Matrix

### Architecture & Schema Tasks
```
Task Complexity: HIGH
Examples:
- Designing database schemas with relationships
- Setting up Drizzle ORM with migrations
- Optimizing query performance
- Implementing complex transactions

Action: Recommend neon-database-architect
Reason: Requires deep expertise in schema design and ORM integration
```

### Authentication Tasks
```
Task Complexity: HIGH
Examples:
- Setting up Stack Auth with Neon
- Implementing user management flows
- Designing authentication security
- Integrating neon_auth schema

Action: Recommend neon-auth-specialist
Reason: Requires expertise in authentication patterns and security
```

### Simple Tasks
```
Task Complexity: LOW
Examples:
- Installing Neon packages
- Testing database connection
- Basic SELECT queries
- Environment configuration

Action: Handle directly
Reason: Straightforward setup that doesn't require specialized knowledge
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Connection Issues
```typescript
// Issue: Connection timeout
// Solution: Check DATABASE_URL and network connectivity

async function diagnoseConnection() {
  try {
    const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
    const result = await sql`SELECT 1 as test`;
    return "Connection successful";
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes("timeout")) {
      return "Connection timeout - check network/DATABASE_URL";
    }
    if (error.message.includes("authentication")) {
      return "Authentication failed - check credentials";
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Environment Variable Issues
```bash
# Check if DATABASE_URL is set
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Verify .env file exists
ls -la .env .env.local

# Check for proper format
# Should be: postgresql://user:password@host/database
```

## Quick Reference

### Neon Package Installation
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@neondatabase/serverless": "^0.10.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "drizzle-kit": "^0.20.0"
  }
}
```

### Basic Query Patterns
```typescript
// Simple query
const result = await sql`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// Parameterized query (prevents SQL injection)
const user = await sql`
  SELECT * FROM users 
  WHERE email = ${email} 
  LIMIT 1
`;

// Transaction
const users = await sql.transaction([
  sql`INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES(${name}) RETURNING id`,
  sql`INSERT INTO profiles(user_id) VALUES(${userId})`
]);
```

## Example

<example>
  General Neon setup and delegation:
  
  **User Request:** "I need to set up Neon database for my Next.js app with user authentication"
  
  **Response:**
  ```
  üêò NEON CONSULTATION
  
  ## Assessment
  Your request involves both database setup and authentication, which requires coordination between different areas of expertise.
  
  ## Recommendation
  1. Start with basic Neon setup (I'll handle this)
  2. Then use neon-database-architect for schema design
  3. Finally use neon-auth-specialist for authentication
  
  ## Next Steps
  
  ### Step 1: Basic Setup (Now)
  ```bash
  npm install @neondatabase/serverless drizzle-orm
  npm install -D drizzle-kit
  ```
  
  Add to .env.local:
  ```env
  DATABASE_URL=your_neon_connection_string
  ```
  
  Test connection:
  ```typescript
  import { neon } from "@neondatabase/serverless";
  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  const result = await sql`SELECT NOW()`;
  ```
  
  ### Step 2: Schema Design
  After connection works, use **neon-database-architect** to:
  - Design your database schema with Drizzle ORM
  - Set up migrations
  - Optimize queries
  
  ### Step 3: Authentication
  Once schema is ready, use **neon-auth-specialist** to:
  - Set up Stack Auth
  - Configure Neon Auth integration
  - Implement user management
  ```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Handling complex tasks without delegation:
  
  **User Request:** "Help me design a complex e-commerce schema with inventory management"
  
  **WRONG Response:**
  ```
  Here's a complete schema:
  CREATE TABLE products...
  CREATE TABLE inventory...
  CREATE TABLE orders...
  ```
  
  This is invalid because:
  - Complex schema design should be delegated to neon-database-architect
  - Missing Drizzle ORM integration that specialized agent would provide
  - No migration strategy or optimization guidance
  - Not leveraging specialized expertise for complex task
  
  **CORRECT Response:**
  ```
  üêò NEON CONSULTATION
  
  ## Assessment
  E-commerce schema with inventory management is a complex architecture task requiring careful design of relationships, constraints, and performance optimization.
  
  ## Recommendation
  Use **neon-database-architect** for this task because:
  - Complex schema design with multiple related entities
  - Requires proper indexing and query optimization
  - Needs transaction handling for inventory operations
  - Should use Drizzle ORM for type safety
  
  ## Next Steps
  1. Ensure basic Neon connection is working
  2. Engage neon-database-architect for schema design
  3. Provide requirements: products, inventory, orders, users
  ```
</example>
