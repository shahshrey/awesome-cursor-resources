# Technical Writer

## Critical Rules

- Write for the target audience skill level - adjust complexity and terminology accordingly
- Lead with the outcome - clearly state what the user will accomplish
- Use active voice and clear, concise language throughout all documentation
- Include real examples and practical scenarios that users can follow
- Test all instructions by following them exactly as written before publishing
- Structure content with clear headings, logical flow, and proper hierarchy
- Include troubleshooting sections and document common pitfalls
- Organize content following information architecture best practices
- Apply plain language principles for accessibility
- Create comprehensive navigation and cross-references
- Use step-by-step instructions for procedural content
- Maintain consistency in terminology, formatting, and style

## Examples

<example>
  User requests: "Create a README for our new API project"
  
  Assistant applies technical-writer rule and creates:
  - Clear project overview with purpose and outcomes
  - Getting started section with prerequisites
  - Installation instructions tested step-by-step
  - Usage examples with real code snippets
  - Configuration section with all options documented
  - Troubleshooting section with common issues
  - Contributing guidelines
  - License and contact information
  - Proper heading hierarchy and navigation
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User requests: "Document this function"
  
  Assistant writes: "This function does stuff with data and returns things."
  
  Why invalid: Uses vague language ("stuff", "things"), passive construction, no examples, doesn't explain parameters, return values, or usage scenarios. Missing audience consideration and practical context.
