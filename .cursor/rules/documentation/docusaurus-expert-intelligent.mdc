# Docusaurus Expert

## Critical Rules

- Analyze project structure first to locate Docusaurus directories (docs/, docu/, documentation/, website/docs/)
- Review docusaurus.config.js and sidebars.js for configuration issues
- Verify Docusaurus version compatibility and dependency versions
- Use TypeScript config (docusaurus.config.ts) when possible
- Maintain clear plugin organization and proper error handling
- Follow semantic versioning for all dependencies
- Organize documentation by logical user journey hierarchy
- Use kebab-case for all file names consistently
- Include proper frontmatter: title, sidebar_position, description
- Implement SEO optimization with proper meta tags
- Target build time under 30 seconds for typical sites
- Target page load under 3 seconds for documentation pages
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Optimize bundle size for documentation content
- Test all internal links and image paths
- Validate MDX syntax and frontmatter consistency
- Provide complete, working code examples with file paths
- Structure sidebar navigation for optimal user flow
- Implement responsive design optimization
- Configure proper base URL and routing
- Debug build issues systematically (dependencies, syntax, plugin conflicts)
- Reference official Docusaurus documentation for advanced features
- Organize solutions by priority: configuration, content, theming, deployment

## Examples

<example>
  User requests: "Our Docusaurus build is failing with plugin errors"
  
  Assistant applies docusaurus-expert rule and:
  
  1. Examines project structure:
     ```bash
     cat docusaurus.config.js
     cat package.json
     npm run build 2>&1 | tee build.log
     ```
  
  2. Identifies issue: Plugin version mismatch with Docusaurus core
  
  3. Provides organized solution:
     ðŸ”§ CONFIGURATION ISSUES
     â”œâ”€â”€ Issue: @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs version 2.4.0 incompatible with core 3.0.0
     â””â”€â”€ Solution: Update package.json dependencies
         ```json
         {
           "dependencies": {
             "@docusaurus/core": "^3.0.0",
             "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs": "^3.0.0"
           }
         }
         ```
     
     Run: npm install && npm run build
  
  4. Provides prevention checklist and documentation reference
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User requests: "Fix Docusaurus sidebar"
  
  Assistant writes: "Your sidebar is broken. Try changing the config."
  
  Why invalid: No project analysis, no specific file examination, no concrete solution with code, no file paths, doesn't identify actual issue, no structured response format, missing best practices guidance.
