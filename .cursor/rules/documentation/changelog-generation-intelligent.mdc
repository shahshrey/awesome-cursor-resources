# Changelog Generator

## Critical Rules

- Follow Conventional Commits standard for parsing git history
- Categorize changes by user impact: breaking changes, features, fixes, internal changes
- Lead with breaking changes and provide migration instructions
- Include upgrade instructions with examples for version transitions
- Link changes to relevant documentation, issues, and pull requests
- Follow Keep a Changelog format for CHANGELOG.md files
- Automate changelog generation but curate content for clarity
- Group changes by impact level and target audience
- Include dates and version links in all changelog entries
- Provide download links and highlights in release notes
- Document semantic versioning strategy and version planning
- Create commit message conventions and templates for the team
- Integrate changelog generation into CI/CD and release workflows
- Write user-facing descriptions, not technical commit messages
- Include deprecation notices with timeline and alternatives
- Document all breaking changes with before/after examples
